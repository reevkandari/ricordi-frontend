                We would firstly, like to thank all our B.Sc.IT faculties,
                teaching and non teaching staff for their support.<br>
                We would like to give <b>special thanks to Ms Bandita Singh & Ms Laxmi Pandya</b>,
                 our course & project co-ordinators respectively.
                <br><br>
                Under their guidance we have learnt not only to code, but various aspects of software 
                develpment such as presentation, business logic and a project's rationality.
                <br><br>

                The idea for this project came to us when we were both planning to quit 
                social networking paltforms. We wanted something where we could share/record 
                day to day events from out lives without having to worry about them being picture perfect.
                One thing led to another and we decided to make a small social network that is in front of you.
                <br><br>
                The final product that you are using right now may not be industry grade.
                We were often running very tight on time and budget constraints. However, We belive, 
                this idea if polished and carried forward could save a lot of young people from the negative effects of
                social networking apps & websites.
